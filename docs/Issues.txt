- In register api, if 'update' is set to 1 then it is posting to his FB stream. (it appears like it was 0 for linked in)
- postListing - still uses consent_linkedin to checked whether to post to stream
- user details stored in db indefinitely and not refreshed automatically
	- need a way to automatically update the db or fetch during the request flow

- Friends api is ready but current not used till it is clear how we are going to use it.
- Location is ready but not used currently since it is not clear how to get 'nearby ' users.
